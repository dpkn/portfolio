The clock consists of a 10x10 grid in which each block resembles 10 minutes, adding up to a total of roughly 17 hours, thus showing only the time an average human is awake. When you go to bed, all of your blocks will be gone. This way of time framing makes you more aware of how you spend your time, hopefully leading to less time wasted on things that don't matter.",
