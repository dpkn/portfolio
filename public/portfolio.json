    "description": "Named after the forget-me-not flower, Myosotis is a prototype of a playful social media app focussed on real-life, offline interaction. The website visually maps your network of friends, and shows you with fading lines how strong your connections are. When you haven't seen a friend for a while or when they indicate they miss you, their visual presence becomes larger, reminding you to meet up with them again. The prototype is made using Vue.js and Firebase.",
